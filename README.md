# pi3
A simple and minimal Python wrapper for the i3bar protocol.

## General idea
`pi3` allows users to create a `Bar` object, and add `Block` instances to it.
The `Block` class permits all customizations to the text output.

# Scripts
`pi3` allows you to create scripts and pass those to a `Block` instance, 
and pi3 automatically pipes output from that script into the Block text.
